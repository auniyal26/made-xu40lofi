# Project Plan

## Title

A study of climate change in India

## Main Question

1. How much has climate change affected India?
3. Has trade been impacted because of this?

## Description

Climate change is something we have talked about since decades and have made several attempts to slow it down, but we have not been able to address the issues it has caused in the process. This project attempts to take a look at how much of an impact climate change has made to the Indian subcontinent. The reason I am focusing on India is due to the fact that India has been in the picture of global expansion since quite a lot of time now and also, it is one of the unfortunate handful of countries that have suffered the most due to climate change. The mode of achieving a thorough analysis of the topic in question is going to be analysis of the dataset of temperature changes in the recent years in India and then taking a look at floods in India, after that, we will look into how imports and exports have changed in the recent years in the port cities and whether or not there was an impact in that sector.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: Temperature Change in India
